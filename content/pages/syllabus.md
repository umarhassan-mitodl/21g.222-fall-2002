Course Description
------------------

The purpose of this course is to develop your writing skills so that you can feel confident writing the essays, term papers, reports, and exams you will have to produce during your career here at MIT. We will read and analyze samples of expository writing, do some work on vocabulary development, and concentrate on developing your ability to write clear, accurate, sophisticated prose. We will also deal with the grammar and mechanical problems you may have trouble with.

Required Materials
------------------

1.  Richek, Margaret Ann. _World of Words: Vocabulary for College Students._ 5th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. (Do not use an earlier edition.)
2.  Hacker, Diana. _Rules for Writers_. 4th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2000.
3.  Course Packet
4.  One non-fiction book from those I ordered (see list at end).
5.  One heavy folder with an interior pocket-- your **portfolio**. Keep all written work (vocabulary and writing assignments) in this portfolio. I will review it each time I grade a paper, to gauge your progress.

Paper and Revisions
-------------------

There will be four major papers:

*   Personal essay: 10%
*   Critical review of a non-fiction book: 10%
*   Position paper: 20%
*   Explanation of a term: 10%

Papers will vary in length, but you can expect to write at least **20 pages** during the course of the semester, including revisions of your work. You will revise at least one of your papers, but you may choose to revise all of them--or I may direct you to. If you receive a B- or lower on a paper, I will require a revision.

Grades
------

Your grade will be based on

*   Essays: 50%
*   Completion of homework: 25%
*   Participation in class: 25%

Oral Component
--------------

This is a communications intensive course. As such, we will also work on developing your oral skills as well as your written skills. There will be:

*   Student-led, whole-class discussions of the reading assignments
*   Student presentation of key vocabulary
*   Small-group discussions

I expect you to participate actively--25% of your grade rests on this.

Grades on Papers
----------------

You will revise all major assignments except the last. Your final grade for the paper will be a combination of the grade for the initial version and the grade for the revised version, with the revised version weighted more heavily.

Late Papers
-----------

If you need an extension on a paper, ask me. I am reasonable. Do not disappear. Do not hide out. Papers that come in late without prior arrangement with me will be marked down.

How to Get an A
---------------

Come to all classes. (More than 3 absences will affect your grade.)  
Participate actively.  
Do all the assignments **before** you come to class.  
Do your reading and written homework.  
Write and rewrite your papers.  
Seek my help in office hours and/or use the Writing Center.  
Write papers worthy of an A.

The Writing Center
------------------

I strongly recommend that you use the Writing Center. Qualified staff are there to help you--but you must **make an appointment** to see them. Plan ahead on this--the Center books up fast. They will give you up to one hour of one-to-one help with your assignments. Invariably, those who use the Writing Center learn more and get better grades on their papers. The instructor, who has taught 21G.222, will be on staff there this semester--ask for him if you can.

Plagiarism
----------

The phrases and sentences that we construct are our property. Using those of another person without citing the source, or copying sentences from another paper, web site, article or book violates copyright laws and is a **very** serious offense in this culture. **Do not do this**. I will speak more about this as the course goes on, but to avoid inadvertent plagiarism,

*   Do **not** have a native speaker "check" your paper.
*   Do **not** have another international student "check" your paper.
*   Do **not** go to the web to find book reviews already written about your book to "get ideas."
*   Download and keep **all** sources you use for your position paper.

To Pass the Course and Receive CI Credit
----------------------------------------

If you are an entering freshman (class of 2006) or a sophomore, you will need to receive a C to pass the course and receive CI credit.

If you are a junior or a senior, the old rules apply--you need to receive a grade of B- or better to receive Phase I writing credit for the course.
